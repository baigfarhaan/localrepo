 Remember the sequence  in Git
 once a new file is added unseer the actual folder
 run the below commands
 1. git status   (it show as untracked file)
 now use add command to add the file 
 2. git add .  (. means all the files)
 now use command commit 
 3. git commit -m  "Add README" (This commits or make changes in the git ub)
 now use the final command git push or git push origin main  (here origin the the page and main is the git repository folder where all sub files are embedded)
 4. git push
